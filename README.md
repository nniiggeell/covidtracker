# Covid Tracker
This personal project was done to familiarise myself with frontend and webdev, by creating a Covid-19 tracker that provides country-specific data, and global statistics. 

The data was fetched from https://api.covid19api.com/summary.

### Project Features
This webpage allows users to view Covid-19 cases and deaths, in total, and for the day. The user can also select specific countries to view the statistics.
